### This program supports encryption and decryption using shift, affine, and
vigenere cipher
##### -Running
• The program should be callable from command line as follows:

- First argument is the cipher type [“shift”,”affine”,”vigenere”].
- Second argument is the operation type [“enc”, “dec”].
- The Third argument is the input file.
- The fourth argument is the output file.
- The last argument is the the list of encryption keys required for the cipher.
